Hi, I'm Daniel Jesuloba
I’m a full-stack developer currently building at PuissantDev with a few brilliant minds. I specialize in React, Node.js, and TypeScript — building performant, scalable products that solve real problems.

I’m deeply drawn to Machine Learning and AI, and I’m steadily evolving my skill set in that space. What drives me is the challenge of turning abstract ideas into functional, intuitive tools people love using.

Outside of tech, I’m into chess, music, and exploring the mind through psychology and philosophy.
