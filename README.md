# Hi there!  

I’m Daniel Jesuloba Ajide, a full stack developer based in Nigeria.  

I enjoy building scalable web and mobile applications, and I’m deeply interested in how AI can be applied to healthcare, businesses, and smart cities.  
Right now, I’m spending a lot of time exploring frontend web design, sharpening my backend skills, and gradually peeking into AI systems.  

Outside of coding, you’ll find me playing chess, making music, gaming, or reading.  

Fun Facts:  
- I prefer simplicity in design and code.  
- I enjoy finding ways to integrate AI into everyday life.
