Hi, I'm Daniel Jesuloba
Iâ€™m a full-stack developer currently building at PuissantDev with a few brilliant minds. I specialize in React, Node.js, and TypeScript â€” building performant, scalable products that solve real problems.

Iâ€™m deeply drawn to Machine Learning and AI, and Iâ€™m steadily evolving my skill set in that space. What drives me is the challenge of turning abstract ideas into functional, intuitive tools people love using.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m into chess, music, and exploring the mind through psychology and philosophy.
